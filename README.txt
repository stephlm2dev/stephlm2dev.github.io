This is Aerial, a single page, single screen responsive site template. Real simple.
Makes heavy use of CSS animation (something I've been messing with a lot lately).
Should work well as a landing page that just directs folks to your stuff elsewhere
on the www. Sass sources are also included, so if you've never used Sass and you're
interested in giving it a try, head on over to sass-lang.com (and if not, you can
safely delete the "sass/" folder).

Questions/comments/issues = just email or find me on Twitter. Have fun!
